// Notes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//
//*****************************************************************************
//
// Heres some notes for development. Ideas that are
// meant to into consideration in the future. Maybe
// some bug lists... or stuff like this.
// Any way this comment block is meant only for dev.
//
// [ ]	In CLog::SetFile() theres a unimplanted
//		feature. If we have already opened a log file
//		you cannot change the name of the log. This
//		could be easily fixed.
//
// [ ]	Another feature is to implent a warning class.
//		like a std::exection. Which could be passed to
//		CLog, when a warning is accured. It would
//		contain some message that would be printed
//		and the log would write its buffer to the in
//		case of a crash.
//
// [x]	All numeric values aren't implented yet.
//
//		All values are now implented with a nice
//		template feature. That insures that I can pretty
//		much give any type of value to CLog
//
// [x]	In the deconstructor we could create a summary
//		of thing. Print the errors and warings that
//		have occured and maybe create html file if the
//		user wants to... Just an idea for future.
//

//		Got bored with the static initialization problems of the logger, so I
//		turned the CLog into a singleton. Also I put the shit behind a pimpl
//		so it would be easier for me to tune the little badger. Also removed
//		the nasty CLogBridge and turned the actual writing of the text file
//		into a generic class which can be used to write to any file using the
//		listener policy. So now everything is cleaner nicer and tidier. Just
//		the way I like it.
//
// 05.08.2005 Pete
//		Fixed the output show that it actually works and is readable. Also made
//		the autoindent system show now logging is even more easier than ever.
//		Also added the log_level system
//
// 08.01.2005 Pete
//		Fixed a bug that caused the whole program to fail. Problam was in the
//		order of static objects being constructed. If ofstream myLog wasn't
//		constructed before CLog::CLog() CLogs constructor would kill the
//		program trying to open a file stream.
//

//! The basic log. Its job is to write things give to it to the log.
/*!
	Uses logger in logger.h as a global entry point for the logger.
	So you can input stuff like:

	  logger << "Hello world" << "\n";

	And it writes it to the log.

	Update:

	Today logger is only define for the returning the a singleton from CLog.

	CLog also works a bridge between different classes, using the ILogListener
	interface.

	This bridges idea is to put a generic method for adding any kind of a window
	or user output for the log. The log will automaticly write ( as default )
	log.txt which is a basic text mode version of the things logged.

	Actually we use this bridge idea internally to write to the default log
	file ( log.txt ).

//
// Some handy rect functions
//
//.............................................................................
//
// 01.01.2006 Pete
//		Added the RectClampInside method
//
// 11.09.2005 Pete
//		Added the IsPointInsideRect method
//
// 06.09.2005 Pete
//		Changed all the methods to support the template classes. I noticed that
//		pretty much all the Rect structures and Point structures shared a
//		internal structure ( x, y, w, h ) and ( x, y ). So I changed these into
//		templated functions. This was done to support the templated Rect class
//		and point class.
//
// 26.02.2005 Pete
//		Added the is CRectIsInside( int x, int y ) method
//
// 26.01.2005 Pete
//		Moved the CCoord to its own file
//
// 16.01.2005 Pete
//		Fixed the bug(s) with CRectBoolean functions
//
// 17.10.2004 Pete
//		Added da CRectAddToList function
//
// 16.10.2004 Pete
//		Added the CRectIsInside() and CRectBooleanConst() with list functions
//		to the collection of rect functions. Also changed the documentation
//		to doxygen style.

	 I found out that if you have two cubes and you want to boolean operate them
	 ( chop them into other cubes so they dont touch each other ) you can always
	 do it with max three cubes. The least is one and the max is three.

	 So that is what this does

	Works only with straight lines. Used by CRectFindCrossPoints(),
	and this is a quite delicate piece of coding, the first has to first.
	Í mean it has to be with lower x and y values then the end. Doesn't
	bother me cause, every line that comes from CRectFindCrossPoints
	is sorted this way, but if you want use this generally i expect
	you to sort things out. Or code a max in front of things. But
	for optimation sake i use it this way.
